  title: Let us solve your critical study challenges
  content: This is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it. The idea behind the technique is that the timer instills a sense of urgency. Rather than feeling like you have endless time in the workday to get things done and then ultimately squandering those precious work hours on distractions, you know you only have specific minutes to make as much progress on a task as possible.

      content: "At the end of each timer, take a minute to write down everything you have accomplished. Keeping a record of your work will allow you to give an impressive and transparent productivity report to your managers or track progress toward your personal goals."
    - name: "Decrease back pain and mental fatigue"
      icon: "/images/user-clock.svg"
      content: "The Technique requires users to take regular breaks. You may walk around your home or office, grab a snack, fill up your water bottle, or play some foosball with a co-worker. Getting up to stretch your legs prevents the onset of desk-induced back and shoulder pain."
    - name: "Maintain motivation"
      icon: "/images/love.svg"
      content: "As you approach the end of a timer and your work is almost done, it becomes an exciting race against the clock to finish before you run out of time. The excitement motivates you to work faster even when you would normally start slowing down."
    - name: "Improve weekly and quarterly planning"
      icon: "/images/speedometer.svg"
      content: "In addition to increasing accountability, recording your accomplishments will make it easier to plan effectively in the future. With time, you will be able to accurately estimate how many timer you will need to complete a certain type of project."
    - name: " Get started easier"
      icon: "/images/cloud.svg"
      content: "Going along with motivation, using this technique can help you to get started for the day more easily. Thinking about your entire day’s to-do list may be daunting, but reframing your perspective to being productive for 25 minutes often feels more attainable."
